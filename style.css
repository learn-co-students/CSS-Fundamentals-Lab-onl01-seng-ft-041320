/*----- Update the header: the text is a little wonky being aligned on the left like that. Provide a property that aligns it in the center instead

----Center our image: We only have one image on the page and we would like it centered!

----Jazz up our navigation links: Let's center all of our nav links as well. Give all of the <a> tags within our navbar a padding of 10px on their left and right sides. In addition, change their background color to something of your choosing. We chose grey!
------
-----Our image caption needs work: Let's shrink that font size down and make sure it is centered.

Update the text block: Wouldn't it look nicer if our text was centered as well? Our image is about 900px wide, so let's give all our <p> within #featured-property a hard width of 800px and center the text in there.

Make our #details section horizontal: The details section could go nicely as a footer to the page, instead of a vertical list. Change its display value to block and make sure each of the <div>s is floating to the left.

As a finishing touch: Let's clean up the <div>s at the bottom of the page. All of them should have the same background color, centered text, and occupy 25% of the width of the bottom row (since we have 4 divs).
